		<ol>1. Mia Mastroianni - Marketing Major - Senior</ol>
		<ol>2. I'm a ComDes minor and I was looking for a class that would teach me technical skills beyond Adobe Suite.</ol>
		<ol>3. I took CSE131 a few years ago, but don't remeber much of it at all.</ol>
		<ol>4. I simply want to leanr what HTML and CSS are and how they interact with each other.</ol>
		<ol>5. I think designing for the screen will involve a lot more thought because in most cases it will be more interactive and will have to be compatible with different formats.</ol>
