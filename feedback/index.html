	<h2>Feedback for Mitali:</h2>
	
	<body>
	<ul>
		<li>I love the image/quote choices! I think the white text stands out well against all of them (some could potentially be darkened). I’m not completely in love with the font - could be worth experimenting with a few different choices.</li>
	</br>
		<li>The placement of the text could be adjusted to feel more natural.. For example, in the first image it could go under his arm to match the curve of his body. The same goes for the second image.. “the” is going in the opposite direction of his body.</li> 
	</br>
		<li> I think some styles could be more consistent throughout. I really like how the text is all left-align in the smaller version of the third image and how there are single words in lines. In the third image the font stays the same size, but in the others it gets smaller.</li>
	</ul>
