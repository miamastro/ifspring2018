		<h4><mark>Born in Mook en Middelaar in 1939, Karel Martens graduated from the Arnhem Academy of Art and Industrial Arts of the Netherlands in 1961 where he studied fine arts. He did not study graphic design because it was not considered a career at the time and therefore, did not exist as its own course of study. In school he took many classes such as painting, sculpture making, illustration, and publicity. Today he is recognized as one of the most influential practitioners in graphic design.</mark></br></br><mark>Many of Martensâ€™ work ranges from posters, to prints and to editorials, but all have a strong emphasis on typography. He had always been fascinated with language, mathematics and color and he finds a way to incorporate all these interests into his designs.</mark></h4>
