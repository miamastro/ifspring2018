		<h3>[Kesha:]</h3>
		<p>I wish somebody would have told me, babe<br>
		Someday, these will be the good old days<br>
		All the love you won't forget<br>
		And all these reckless nights you won't regret<br>
		Someday soon, your whole life's gonna change<br>
		You'll miss the magic of these good old days</p>
		
		<h3>[Macklemore:]</h3>
		<p>I was thinkin' 'bout the band<br>
		I was thinkin' 'bout the fans<br>
		We were underground<br>
		Loadin' merch in that 12-passenger van<br>
		In a small club in Minnesota<br>
		And the snow outside of 1st Ave<br>
		I just wanted my name in a star<br>
		Now look at where we at<br>
		Still growin' up, still growin' up<br>
		I would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become<br>
		Couldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some<br>
		Now that I'm here, wishing I was still young<br>
		Those good old days</p>

		<h3>[Kesha:]</h3>
		<p>I wish somebody would have told me, babe<br>
		That someday, these will be the good old days<br>
		All the love you won't forget<br>
		And all these reckless nights you won't regret<br>
		'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change<br>
		You'll miss the magic of the good old days</p>

		<h3>[Macklemore:]</h3>
		<p>Wish I didn't think I had the answers<br>
		Wish I didn't drink all of that glass first<br>
		Wish I made it to homecoming<br>
		Got up the courage to ask her<br>
		Wish I would've gotten out of my shell<br>
		Wish I put the bottle back on that shelf<br>
		Wish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought<br>
		And felt comfortable in myself<br>
		Rooftop open, and the stars above<br>
		Moment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love<br>
		Me, you and that futon, we'd just begun<br>
		On the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was<br>
		Those good old days</p>

		<h3>[Kesha:]</h3>
		<p>I wish somebody would have told me, babe<br>
		That someday, these will be the good old days<br>
		All the love you won't forget<br>
		And all these reckless nights you won't regret<br>
		'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change<br>
		You'll miss the magic of the good old days</p>

		<h3>[Macklemore and Kesha:]</h3>
		<p>Never thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young<br>
		Maybe you always look back and think it was better than it was<br>
		Maybe these are the moments<br>
		Maybe I've been missin' what it's about<br>
		Been scared of the future, thinkin' about the past<br>
		While missin' out on now<br>
		We've come so far, I guess I'm proud<br>
		And I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile<br>
		I've got some scars, I've been around<br>
		I've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now<br>
		Those good old days</p>

		<h3>[Kesha:]</h3>
		<p>You don't know what you've got<br>
		'Til it goes, 'til it's gone<br>
		You don't know what you've got<br>
		'Til it goes, 'til it's gone</p>

		<p>I wish somebody would have told me, babe<br>
		That someday, these will be the good old days<br>
		All the love you won't forget<br>
		And all these reckless nights you won't regret<br>
		'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change<br>
		You'll miss the magic of the good old days</p>
